# Greetings

I'm a front-end developer who builds tools for table top rpgs in my spare time. My primary focus has been on Roll20 APIs and [character sheets](https://emeraldproductions.herokuapp.com/roll_20_character_sheets). Lately, I have been building tools on my [personal site](http://cassielevett.info/) to harness the power of React.
